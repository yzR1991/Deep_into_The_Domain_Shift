# Deep_into_The_Domain_Shift_Transfer_Learning_through_Dependence_Regularization
This is an official Python implementation of Deep into The Domain Shift: Transfer Learning through Dependence Regularization. 

All experiments could be ran with Pytorch of version higher than 1.7.

The default experiment is on the UCI dataset of wine quality, and one could run it locally and see the result in Code Ocean. Due to the size and safety of the datasets for stock prices and customer credits, we upload them to the cloud of Code Ocean.
