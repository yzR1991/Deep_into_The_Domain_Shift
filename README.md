# Deep_into_The_Domain_Shift
We use copula functions to describe relations between features. By aligning marginal distributions and copula functions between domains, we propose CDAN which outperforms a variety of domain adaptation benchmarks. Three datasets are considered, namely UCI wine quality, HK stock price, and retail data.

The default experiment is on the UCI dataset of wine quality, and one could run it locally and see the result in Code Ocean. Due to the size and safety of the datasets for the other experiments, we upload them to the cloud of Code Ocean.
