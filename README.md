# Deep_into_The_Domain_Shift
We use copula functions to describe relations between features. By aligning marginal distributions and copula functions between domains, we propose CDAN which outperforms a variety of domain adaptation benchmarks. Three datasets are considered, namely UCI wine quality, HK stock price, and retail data. The default experiment is on the UCI dataset of wine quality.
